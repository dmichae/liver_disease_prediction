# Liver Disease Prediction

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that predicts liver disease in patients. The project makes use of the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) and applies Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest models to make predictions.

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a patient has liver disease based on various patient attributes. The project involves several steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The ILPD data is cleaned and standardized. This includes handling missing values, converting data types as needed, and scaling numeric features.

2. Modeling: Two types of models are used for predictions: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models to achieve the best performance.
